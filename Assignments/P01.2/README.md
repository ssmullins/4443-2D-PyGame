## Camera View
### Samuel Mullins
### Description:
### This is the starter code for a 2d Slither.io type game. In this stage it is just a window with a player and a background but now I have added a camera view so the player can travel around the map and the camera will follow them.

### Instructions:
I coded my program in Visual Code and currently it is not ran with command line params but that will be added.
To run the program type the command `python game_pt2.py
Once the program is running in this stage of development all you can do is move your player around the window with the arrow keys on the keyboard.
### Example Command:
- `python <code>`
- `python game_pt2.py
### Example Display:
