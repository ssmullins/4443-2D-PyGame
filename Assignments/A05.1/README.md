### Instructions:
I coded my program in Visual Code and ran it from the Git Bash shell.
You must make sure you are in the correct directory where your program is stored.
To run the program type the command `python game.py title="{name your game}" img_path=./images/player.png{if passing in a sprite image} width={set width of window} height={set height of window} pwidth={set width of player} pheight{set height of player}.
You can change all params being passed in. Name of your game, image for player, width and height of window and player.
Once the program is running in this stage of development all you can do is move your player around the window with the arrow keys on the keyboard.
### Example Command:
- `python <code>`
- `python game.py title="My Game" igm_path=./images/player.png width=700 height=600 pwidth=75 pheight=90`
