### Description:

### Instructions:
I coded my program in Visual Code and currently it is not ran with command line params but that will be added.
To run the program type the command `python game_pt3.py
Once the program is running in this stage of development all you can do is move your player around the window with the arrow keys on the keyboard.
### Example Command:
- `python <code>`
